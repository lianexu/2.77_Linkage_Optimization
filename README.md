## CasADi + MATLAB linkage optimization for 2.77 class. 

setup4BarElevated.m: builds helper functions that algebraically and symbolically build equations for kinematics and forces defined in build4BarElevatedKinematics.m

run4BarElevatedOpt.m: sets up cost function, constraints, and solves for optimal linkage configurations

testing4BarElevated.m: displays geometry and animates kinematics
